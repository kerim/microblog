I only ever read one book by [V.S. Naipaul](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/11/obituaries/vs-naipaul-dead-author-nobel-prize.html), his Islamophobic travelog from the early eighties, but it put me off ever reading another book by him. Wondering if I should give his fiction a try? Or will it just piss me off more?
