The official twitter app makes it nearly impossible to use Twitter's own "lists" function. If Twitter [breaks 3rd party apps](https://www.macstories.net/news/twitter-delays-transition-to-new-api-that-threatens-third-party-clients/), they break my ability to use Twitter. Please continue to support developers! #BreakingMyTwitter
