This review of Milko Lazarov’s film Ága makes it sound pretty offensive. A film about an Inuit couple, where the man is named "Nanook,” is a “[paean to a dying culture](https://variety.com/2018/film/reviews/aga-review-berlinale-2018-1202709567/).” Sounds more like Edward "Vanishing Race" Curtis than Robert Flaherty…
