My blog post on “[Hobbes the Science Fiction Writer](https://anthrodendum.org/2018/03/22/hobbes-the-science-fiction-writer-part-i/)” got so long I had to split it into two posts. Spoilers from Star Trek: Discovery and Black Panther will be in Part II—the first part only has spoilers for those who haven't read Hobbes's Leviathan yet…
