“notifications that come in while you're asleep won't appear on the Lock screen. This way, if you wake up in the middle of the night and grab your iPhone to check the time or quickly do something in an app, you won't first be confronted by the demands of the outside world” 

I’ve lost many a night’s sleep because I accidentally saw a notification I would rather not have seen till I was fully awake.
