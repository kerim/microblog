The US asking for [social media details from visa applicants](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/visa-applicants-social-media-details-email-addresses-phone-numbers/) is a terrible policy. Visa rules are usually reciprocal, which means US citizens will soon be expected to do the same when we apply for visas to travel abroad, possibly even putting US citizens in danger as a result!
