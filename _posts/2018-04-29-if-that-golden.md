Everyone concerned about the implications of the Golden State Killer being tracked by [matching DNA his relatives had posted online](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/27/health/dna-privacy-golden-state-killer-genealogy.html) to an open genealogical database should take a moment to consider that “Chinese authorities in Xinjiang are collecting DNA samples, fingerprints, iris scans, and blood types of all residents in the region between the age of 12 and 65.” (Read [the full HRW report](https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/12/13/china-minority-region-collects-dna-millions).) Or the fact that India's poorest now have to [give biometric information](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/indias-vast-biometric-program-was-supposed-to-end-corruption-but-the-neediest-may-be-hit-hardest/2018/03/24/bb212a86-289c-11e8-a227-fd2b009466bc_story.html?utm_term=.f8575ad4099e) to receive any form of government aid.
