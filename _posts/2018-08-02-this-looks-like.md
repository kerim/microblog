This looks like an important new book 📚! 
> [Placing Empire](https://www.luminosoa.org/site/books/10.1525/luminos.34/) examines the spatial politics of Japanese imperialism through a study of Japanese travel and tourism to Korea, Manchuria, and Taiwan between the late nineteenth century and the early 1950s.
