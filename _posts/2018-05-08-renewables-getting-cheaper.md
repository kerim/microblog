Here are the three key takeaways from [Lazard’s latest annual Levelized Cost of Energy Analysis](https://www.lazard.com/perspective/levelized-cost-of-energy-2017/).

One: “in some scenarios the full-lifecycle costs of building and operating renewables-based projects have dropped below the operating costs alone of conventional generation technologies such as coal or nuclear."

and

Two: “Global costs of generating electricity from alternative energy technologies continue to decline."

but….

Three. “alternative energy systems alone will not be capable of meeting the base-load generation needs of a developed economy for the foreseeable future. Therefore, the optimal solution for many regions of the world is to use complementary conventional and alternative energy resources in a diversified generation fleet.”
