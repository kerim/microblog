> this classic of political philosophy does not begin with a discussion of sovereignty, political laws, the concept of society or other issues contemporary political philosophers get excited about. Quite the contrary, Hobbes commences his work with the genesis and function of sense perception, a topic that contemporary philosophers of whatever denomination would not even dare to touch upon anymore, leaving it safely in the hands of the scientists.

Leijenhorst, C. 2007. “Sense and Nonsense about Sense: Hobbes and the Aristotelians on Sense Perception and Imagination.”
