Fantastic news for my good friend Darryl Sterk whose translation of Wu Ming-Yiâ€™s _The Stolen Bicycle_ made [the long list](http://themanbookerprize.com/news/man-booker-international-2018-longlist) for the 2018 Man Booker International Prize! (Wu is a fellow professor at NDHU, but I don't know him well.)
