For over a decade, I've been able to keep my T-mobile pre-paid number in the US active by topping up the card with cash each year at this time; but it [seems that they started phasing out that program a few years ago](https://www.prepaidphonenews.com/2014/08/good-news-bad-news-changes-coming-to-t.html). As of today the system no longer recognizes my number! 🤬🤬🤬
