This story, "[High-skilled Indian workers rally for Trump’s merit-based immigration plan](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/dc-politics/high-skilled-indian-workers-rally-for-trumps-merit-based-immigration-plan/2018/02/03/702e617e-08fd-11e8-8777-2a059f168dd2_story.html)," reminded me of the film [Gentleman's Agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gentleman's_Agreement) where Gregory Peck's Jewish secretary is worried that ending workplace descrimination at his newspaper will lead to "the 'wrong Jews' \[being] hired and will ruin things for the few Jews working there now."
