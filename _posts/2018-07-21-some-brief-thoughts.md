It seems to me that Trump’s love of Russian is [not about policy](https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/07/19/the-manchurian-idiot-helsinki-putin-trump/), but about a [shared racist, patriarchal, world view](https://twitter.com/HeerJeet/status/1019003028265885696). That, and his [financial dependency](https://newrepublic.com/article/143586/trumps-russian-laundromat-trump-tower-luxury-high-rises-dirty-money-international-crime-syndicate) on the Russian mob. I think that those things, along with [Russian meddling in the election](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/07/20/confession-of-a-no-longer-russiagate-skeptic-219022), are enough to explain Trump’s actions, [without need to invoke the ‘pee tapes’](https://www.vox.com/conversations/2017/2/22/14697718/trump-putin-helsinki-meeting-hillary-clinton).

What to do about Russian meddling? I agree with Seth Ackerman that rather than freaking out about “treason,” we should be looking at “[practical steps to deal with the problem](https://www.jacobinmag.com/2018/07/russia-election-meddling-putin)” which [few people are doing](https://www.jacobinmag.com/2018/07/trump-putin-russia-liberals-helsinki)… I suppose some think yelling “treason” enough will win Republicans over to impeaching Trump, but it seems [hard to tell](https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2018/07/19/us/politics/ap-us-trump-democrats-treason.html) if that would work or just backfire? Personally, I would really like to see the US [switch to paper ballots](https://www.vox.com/2018/4/3/17189906/russian-election-hacking-paper-ballots). 

As far as the well documented history of the US interfering in foreign elections is concerned, I think Nathan Robinson is right that "[Trump exceptionalism will kill every one of your brain cells](https://www.currentaffairs.org/2018/07/liberalism-and-empire)." And commentators should retain some perspective, but those on the left should equally be wary of descending into the kind of "[whataboutery](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/whataboutery)" that liberals so often use to undermine those issues the left holds dear.

### UPDATES:
- NPR [considers](https://www.npr.org/2018/07/20/630659379/is-trump-the-toughest-ever-on-russia?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter) whether "this administration has been much tougher on Russia than any in the post-Cold War era"?
