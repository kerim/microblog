This amazing resilience is a product of both resistance and adaptation. This panel looks at these strategies through the lens of indigenous visual culture, including papers on fine art, documentary and feature film, television, and livestreaming on social media. Drawing on work in linguistic anthropology, these papers explore the wide variety of ways in which indigenous identities have been indexed (Silverstein 2003) through visual representation as well as the language in which those representations are embedded. Taiwanese indigeneity has played an increasingly iconic role in debates over Taiwanese national identity. Accordingly, these papers explore the shifting chronotopes (Bakhtin 1981) of indigeneity at work focus has shifted from more recent immigration to Taiwan (by Chinese settlers) to ancient migrations out of Taiwan (by Austronesian explorers). Within the larger framework of Taiwan‚Äôs shifting chronotopes, the six papers on this panel further tackle issues relating to the production, dissemination, and language of indigenous visual media in Taiwan. Two of the papers (Ritts and Tsai) explore the aesthetic choices made in the production process. Ritts asks what it means to make ‚Äúslow TV‚Äù on Taiwan‚Äôs indigenous television station, while Tsai explores his own use of sensory ethnography in documenting ‚ÄòAmis spearfishing practices. Two of the papers (Friedman and Siku) explore the dissemination of documentary films by and about indigenous Taiwanese. Friedman explores the shifting chronotopes of ethnographic films over the history of the Taiwan International Ethnographic Film Festival (TIEFF), while Siku looks at how one indigenous filmmaker and activist, Mayaw Biho, has been making use of video livestreaming. The last two papers (Sterk and Lee) both look at the role of language in visual culture. Sterk explores the role of endangered languages in feature films, as well as how those films are interpreted by indigenous audiences, while Lee explores the shifting linguistic framing of indigenous art works for exhibition audiences. Although focused on Taiwan, these papers ask fundamental questions about indigeneity and visual culture while making innovative use of theoretical paradigms drawn from linguistic anthropology.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n",

That, and his <a href=\"https://newrepublic.com/article/143586/trumps-russian-laundromat-trump-tower-luxury-high-rises-dirty-money-international-crime-syndicate\">financial dependency</a> on the Russian mob. I think that those things, along with <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/07/20/confession-of-a-no-longer-russiagate-skeptic-219022\">Russian meddling in the election</a>, are enough to explain Trump‚Äôs actions, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/conversations/2017/2/22/14697718/trump-putin-helsinki-meeting-hillary-clinton\">without need to invoke the ‚Äòpee tapes‚Äô</a>.</p>\n\n<p>What to do about Russian meddling? I agree with Seth Ackerman that rather than freaking out about ‚Äútreason,‚Äù we should be looking at ‚Äú<a href=\"https://www.jacobinmag.com/2018/07/russia-election-meddling-putin\">practical steps to deal with the problem</a>‚Äù which <a href=\"https://www.jacobinmag.com/2018/07/trump-putin-russia-liberals-helsinki\">few people are doing</a>‚Ä¶ I suppose some think yelling ‚Äútreason‚Äù enough will win Republicans over to impeaching Trump, but it seems <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2018/07/19/us/politics/ap-us-trump-democrats-treason.html\">hard to tell</a> if that would work or just backfire? Personally, I would really like to see the US <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2018/4/3/17189906/russian-election-hacking-paper-ballots\">switch to paper ballots</a>.</p>\n\n<p>As far as the well documented history of the US interfering in foreign elections is concerned, I think Nathan Robinson is right that ‚Äú<a href=\"https://www.currentaffairs.org/2018/07/liberalism-and-empire\">Trump exceptionalism will kill every one of your brain cells</a>.‚Äù And commentators should retain some perspective, but those on the left should equally be wary of descending into the kind of ‚Äú<a href=\"https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/whataboutery\">whataboutery</a>‚Äù that liberals so often use to undermine those issues the left holds dear.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"updates\">UPDATES:</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li>NPR <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2018/07/20/630659379/is-trump-the-toughest-ever-on-russia?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter\">considers</a> whether ‚Äúthis administration has been much tougher on Russia than any in the post-Cold War era‚Äù?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.breakingburgh.com/cuba-greatly-concerned-presence-russian-client-state-90-miles-away/\">Image source</a></p>\n\n",
