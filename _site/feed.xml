        <description>&lt;p&gt;Very happy to have my microblog now running under my own domain: &lt;a href=&quot;https://micro.oxus.net&quot;&gt;micro.oxus.net&lt;/a&gt; You can even subscribe to it with an RSS reader! And my entire microblog is being mirrored to my github repository if I ever want to self-host it. Support the open web!&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Regarding &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/10/20/pets-allowed&quot;&gt;this New Yorker article&lt;/a&gt; about emotional-support animals: yes, abuse of the system hurts people with real needs, but perhaps this “abuse” is allowed to happen because we just like having animals around?&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;The problem with micro.blog and mastodon is that they are trying to do away with algorithmic timelines altogether; but the thing is that people actually &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt; algorithmic timelines! What we need is a network with open source, transparent, user-configurable, algorithms!&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;This story, “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/dc-politics/high-skilled-indian-workers-rally-for-trumps-merit-based-immigration-plan/2018/02/03/702e617e-08fd-11e8-8777-2a059f168dd2_story.html&quot;&gt;High-skilled Indian workers rally for Trump’s merit-based immigration plan&lt;/a&gt;,” reminded me of the film &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gentleman&#39;s_Agreement&quot;&gt;Gentleman’s Agreement&lt;/a&gt; where Gregory Peck’s Jewish secretary is worried that ending workplace descrimination at his newspaper will lead to “the ‘wrong Jews’ [being] hired and will ruin things for the few Jews working there now.” &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Why I am testing out micro.blog</title>
        
        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Those were great years — but then a few tragedies happened: Google Reader came out, and then, almost worse, it went away. Worse still was the rise of Twitter and Facebook, when we decided it would be okay to give up ownership and let just a couple companies own our communication… Even if those companies had the public interest in mind — and they most definitely do not — they hold far too much power over something too fundamental to give up: our own human voices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
