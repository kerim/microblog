  <p>I was trying to set up a microblog and didn’t even know it. I was personally motivated a sense that giving all my content to Facebook and Twitter is giving up too much. Although I blog regularly on <a href="https://anthrodendum.org">anthro{dendum}</a>, I wanted to start using my own blog, <a href="https://keywords.oxus.net">Keywords</a>, more for sharing all that stuff that I normally post to social media. I didn’t want to stop using social media, I just wanted to have more of a sense of ownership over the content I post there. </p>

<p>The problem is that it is so much easier to post stuff to Facebook and Twitter from my phone using their apps, or <a href="https://pragmaticcode.com/linky/">Linky</a>,  than it is to post to my own blog. Part of that is my fault. I moved my blog off of WordPress to a very geeky platform called <a href="https://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>. While it is possible to post to Jekyll from my phone using <a href="https://workingcopyapp.com">Working Copy</a> and some scripts you can find on the web, the whole process isn’t that great. It was while I was Googling for something better that I discovered the wonderful <a href="https://micro.blog">Micro.Blog</a>by <a href="https://manton.org">Manton Reece</a>. Within five minutes I gave up trying to automate posting to Keywords from my phone and instead paid for a microblog . . . which is what you are looking for now. </p>

<h2 id="what-is-microblog">What is Micro.Blog?</h2>
<p>At the most basic level, Micro.Blog is just a hosted Jekyll blog. Why would you pay $5 a month for this when you can <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-as-a-static-site-generator-with-github-pages/">host your own Jekyll blog for free on Github</a>? That’s because of the app, which makes it super easy to write posts, including posts with images, directly from your phone or desktop. Moreover, you can host it <a href="http://help.micro.blog/2015/custom-domains/">under your own domain name</a> (as I do). Even better, you can <a href="http://help.micro.blog/2016/mirroring-to-github/">mirror your entire blog</a> to your own Github account in realtime, so you are never locked in. You can go back to hosting it yourself whenever you like!</p>

<h2 id="but-thats-not-all---">But that’s not all . . .</h2>
<p>I don’t know what kind of pixie dust Manton uses, but he did much more than just make a nice interface for hosting your own Jekyll blog. He set out to make an open alternative to Twitter that functions like an old-time blog. Within the app or on the <a href="https://micro.blog">Micro.Blog</a> website you have a Twitter-like timeline with <a href="https://micro.blog/replies">@replies</a>. You can also follow other users and “like” their posts. And you don’t even need to host your microblog with Manton to benefit from this - you can push posts from your own microblog as well!</p>

<h2 id="but-wait-theres-more---">But wait, there’s more . . .</h2>
<p>As I said at the top, my goal was never to leave social media behind, just to get a sense of ownership of my content. Micro.Blog understands that and in the same way that social media is parasitic on the traditional web, Micro.Blog is parasitic on social media. You can easily set up for all your posts to be forwarded to your Twitter and Facebook accounts — something that <a href="https://joinmastodon.org">Mastodon</a> still makes hard to do. (See here for the rules regarding <a href="http://help.micro.blog/2018/timeline-rules/">what part of your post gets posted</a> to social media, depending on the length of the post and whether or not it contains an image.) And, of course, because it is just a blog, you have a nice old-fashioned RSS feed as well. </p>

<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final thoughts</h2>
<p>Micro.blog isn’t for everyone. It is still a work in process and there are a few kinks to work out. Although there are a lot of tricky things about Facebook and Twitter, this adds another layer of complexity. (Not everyone wants to learn how to format posts in <a href="http://help.micro.blog/2017/markdown/">Markdown</a>.) But it already works better for me than what I was doing before, so I’m personally really impressed with it. Even if the alternative social-feed aspects never evolve into a Facebook destroyer, you still have a very nice way to update a Jekyll blog from your phone!</p>

<p>Regarding the social media aspect though, I do think that sites like Micro.Blog and Mastodon will eventually need to think about implementing their own algorithmic timelines. Even though part of the motivation for moving away from Facebook and Twitter is that we have increasingly less control over what they show us, I don’ t think there are many people who want to see <em>all</em> of my posts, not to mention all of your other friends who share too much on social media. If they work well algorithms should show us more of what we want to see and less of what we don’t. I think a really successful open alternative to Facebook or Twitter will eventually need to think about what an open algorithm might look like. </p>
