<p>It seems to me that Trump’s love of Russian is <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/07/19/the-manchurian-idiot-helsinki-putin-trump/">not about policy</a>, but about a <a href="https://twitter.com/HeerJeet/status/1019003028265885696">shared racist, patriarchal, world view</a>. That, and his <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/143586/trumps-russian-laundromat-trump-tower-luxury-high-rises-dirty-money-international-crime-syndicate">financial dependency</a> on the Russian mob. I think that those things, along with <a href="https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/07/20/confession-of-a-no-longer-russiagate-skeptic-219022">Russian meddling in the election</a>, are enough to explain Trump’s actions, <a href="https://www.vox.com/conversations/2017/2/22/14697718/trump-putin-helsinki-meeting-hillary-clinton">without need to invoke the ‘pee tapes’</a>.</p>

<p>What to do about Russian meddling? I agree with Seth Ackerman that rather than freaking out about “treason,” we should be looking at “<a href="https://www.jacobinmag.com/2018/07/russia-election-meddling-putin">practical steps to deal with the problem</a>” which <a href="https://www.jacobinmag.com/2018/07/trump-putin-russia-liberals-helsinki">few people are doing</a>… I suppose some think yelling “treason” enough will win Republicans over to impeaching Trump, but it seems <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2018/07/19/us/politics/ap-us-trump-democrats-treason.html">hard to tell</a> if that would work or just backfire? Personally, I would really like to see the US <a href="https://www.vox.com/2018/4/3/17189906/russian-election-hacking-paper-ballots">switch to paper ballots</a>.</p>

<p>As far as the well documented history of the US interfering in foreign elections is concerned, I think Nathan Robinson is right that “<a href="https://www.currentaffairs.org/2018/07/liberalism-and-empire">Trump exceptionalism will kill every one of your brain cells</a>.” And commentators should retain some perspective, but those on the left should equally be wary of descending into the kind of “<a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/whataboutery">whataboutery</a>” that liberals so often use to undermine those issues the left holds dear.</p>
